# CS50AI

This repository contains the code I wrote to complete the projects of <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/">Harvard's CS50 Artificial Intelligence course</a>, during August 2020.

The repo is structured similarly to the course, each week had projects and each project had its own files, usually many files were needed for it to work properly. However, I've included here exclusively python files that I have, wholly or partially written.

The subject of the course, and thereby of the repo, is Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Each weak had distinct focus and challenges, ranging from the basics of the most well known search (BFS, DFS, A*, etc) and optimization algorithms to Neural Networks (using TensorFlow) and Natural Language Processing.

It was a blast studying this course's material and solving its challenges. I am deeply grateful to all those who made it possible.
