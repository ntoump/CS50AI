# CS50AI

This repository contains the code I wrote to complete the projects of <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/">Harvard's CS50 Artificial Intelligence course</a>, during August 2020.

The repo is structured similarly to the course, each week has projects and each project has its own files, _usually many files were needed for the programs to operate as expected_. However, I've included here exclusively python files that I have wholly or partially written.

The subject of the course, and thereby of the repo, is Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Each weak has a distinct focus and challenges, ranging from the basics of the most well known search (BFS, DFS, A*, etc) and optimization algorithms to Neural Networks (using TensorFlow) and Natural Language Processing.

It was a blast studying this course's material and solving its challenges. I am deeply grateful to all those who made it possible.
