# CS50AI


This repository contains the code I wrote to complete the projects of <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/">Harvard's CS50 Artificial Intelligence course</a>, during August 2020.

The repo is structured similarly to the course, each week has projects and each project has its own files, _usually many files were needed for the programs to operate as expected_. However, I've only included here the Python files that I have written. In most cases the files will be referencing to outside sources in order to function properly, which will limit their practical functionality significantly.

The subject of the course, and thereby of the repo, is Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Each weak has a distinct focus and challenges, ranging from the basics of the most well known search (BFS, DFS, A*, et cetera) and optimization algorithms to the more complicated topics of Neural Networks (using TensorFlow) and Natural Language Processing.

It was a blast studying this course's material and solving its challenges. I am deeply grateful to all those who made it possible.



###### NOTE: It is possible that the program has, partially or entirely, been changed since I completed it, in August of 2020.
